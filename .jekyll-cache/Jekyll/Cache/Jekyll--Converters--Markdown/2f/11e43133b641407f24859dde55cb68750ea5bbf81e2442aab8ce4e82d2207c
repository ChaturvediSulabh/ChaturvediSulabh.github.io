<p><img src="../assets/img/cka.png" alt="CKA" /></p>

<p>I recently passed my CKA exam with 92%. While prepping for the exam, I had read a lot of blogs about the CKA exam and found each of them very helpful. So, I decided to share my experience as well.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Everything mentioned in this blog is my own experience/thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="exam-overview">Exam Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is a practical exam with 24 questions, the exam covers all scenarios that, youâ€™ll most probably encounter as a Kubernetes Cluster admin i.e. from installing a cluster to operating/managing multiple clusters.</li>
  <li>Kubernetes version: 1.18 (on the date of writing this blog)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="skills-needed-to-clear-the-exam">Skills needed to clear the exam</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Kubernetes (obviously)</li>
  <li>Docker (troubleshooting with docker ps, docker logs etc.)</li>
  <li>Basic Linux system administration ( systemd, journalctl, file permissions, package management, basic bash scripting, and commands (cat, here-doc, tr, awk, cut, sed, netstat/ss, ps, tee, etc.) vim, etc. )</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prep-work">Prep Work</h2>

<p>I did following in exact order and it took around ~2 months from preparation to the exam (I could only give 1 to 2 hours a day to prepare for the exam and I wasnâ€™t actively working on Kubernetes from past 6 months)</p>

<h2 id="less-than-24-hours-before-the-exam">Less than 24 hours before the exam</h2>

<p>Finally, I prepped a list of questions that, I was struggling with and I implemented those questions a day before the exam and just a few hours before the exam.</p>

<p>Technically, I bootstrapped my own kubeadm clusters, broke it and played enough with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here a takeaway for me was, <strong>use calico for CNI, if youâ€™re asked to bootstrap the cluster</strong>. Why? Because weave-net and others many at times gives an error when a custom pod-cidr is not provided. whereas, Calico will automatically detect which IP address range to use for pod IPs based on the value provided via the â€“pod-network-cidr flag or via kubeadmâ€™s configuration.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>You may be thinking, Did I over-prepare? Maybe. But, was it worth it? Absolutely, I gained a lot of confidence, I felt very well-prepared and <strong>I finished my exam 25 minutes before</strong>, thatâ€™s right 25 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>My advice to all aspirants is, prepare well, know your craft, practice a lot and go ace it.</strong>
